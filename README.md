# Evaluating Climate Change Vulnerability Characteristics of New York City using Machine Learning Methods

## Abstract
Urban areas in geographically diverse nations like the U.S. encounter distinct challenges that require a more tailored approach. Therefore, climate vulnerability assessments that integrate community based knowledge and diverse data dimensions are critical, as they help reduce climate-induced risks, provide insights to support more effective city-level planning, and help policymakers and practitioners to address localized challenges. 
This research aims to develop a climate vulnerability assessment tailored to New York City (NYC) at the NTA level. The innovative methodology leverages data science techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and machine learning algorithms such as Autoencoder and clustering. These methods assess climate vulnerability across three key dimensions : socioeconomic, physical, and environmental and specific vulnerability patterns within each urban area are being investigated to distinguish areas with similar climate risks but varying underlying factors.
The findings will offer strategic insights for decision-makers, supporting precise actions to tackle urban vulnerabilities effectively. Furthermore, the methodologyâ€™s adaptability allows for its application in various urban contexts, creating a model for localized climate vulnerability analysis.
